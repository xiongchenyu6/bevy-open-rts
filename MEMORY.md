# Open Bevy Online Notes

- Bevy Open RTS uses Bevy 0.19 and runs its simulation in normal `Update`
  systems with floating-point transforms and timers. It is not deterministic
  enough for peer lockstep without a much larger simulation rewrite.
- Existing orders contain local Bevy `Entity` handles. Online commands need
  stable network IDs and host-side resolution/validation.
- `matchbox_socket` 0.14 supports native and wasm WebRTC with multiple reliable
  and unreliable channels. `bevy_matchbox` currently targets an older Bevy, so
  the project integrates `matchbox_socket` directly.
- Matchbox's standard wire format is `JsonPeerRequest`/`JsonPeerEvent` from
  `matchbox_protocol`. The custom Open Bevy server retains this format so the
  stock socket client remains compatible.
- The signaling container was built and run locally on 2026-07-24. Docker
  reported it healthy; `/healthz`, `/metrics`, and `/v1/config` were exercised,
  including dynamically issued Coturn REST credentials.
- Browser WebSocket clients cannot attach an Authorization header. Connection
  tickets therefore use query parameters; production proxies must use WSS and
  must not persist request URIs.
- `open-bevy-net` uses `ehttp` for one HTTP API on native/wasm without requiring
  a Tokio runtime in Bevy. Its Matchbox message-loop future is executor-neutral
  and can run on Bevy's task pool.
- A real native WebRTC integration test starts the custom server, creates a room
  through `RoomServiceClient`, connects two stock Matchbox sockets with host ICE
  candidates, and verifies both reliable and unreliable payload delivery.
